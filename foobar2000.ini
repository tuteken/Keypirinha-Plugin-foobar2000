[var]
# As usual in Keyprinha's configuration files, you may optionally include a
# [var] section as a placeholder for the definition of variables that are
# reusable anywhere else in this file.
#
# Also note that the [var] section is inherited, which means that any value
# defined in the main configuration file of the application (i.e.:
# "Keypirinha.ini") has already been made available to this file as well so you
# do not need to duplicate them here.
#
# REMINDER: Keypirinha's pre-defined values are: APP_DIR, APP_EXE, PROFILE_DIR,
# PROFILE_DIR_INSTALLED_PACKS, PROFILE_DIR_LIVE_PACKS and PROFILE_DIR_USER.
# See the documentation for more information

[env]
# As usual in Keyprinha's configuration files, the [env] section is
# automatically included and populated at runtime. It contains every user's
# environment variable.
#
# Keypirinha detects when the environment changes. When it does, the environment
# block is updated and a ENV_CHANGED message is broadcasted to every loaded
# plugins so the plugin has a chance to reload configuration if needed.
